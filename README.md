# About the Project: Blackjack
In this Python code, I have created a text-based Blackjack game that allows users to play against the computer. The game interface is clear and engaging, displaying cards, scores, and outcomes dynamically in the console. By incorporating functions for dealing cards, calculating scores, and managing game flow, I aimed to create an enjoyable and interactive Blackjack experience.
